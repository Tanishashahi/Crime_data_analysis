# Crime_data_analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`[YourNotebookFileName].ipynb`) that explores [briefly describe the purpose of the notebook, e.g., data analysis on a specific dataset, implementation of a machine learning model, visualization of a phenomenon].

**Note on Notebook Size:**

Due to the inclusion of interactive visualizations and/or large outputs, the original Jupyter Notebook file exceeded GitHub's 25MB limit. To make the repository manageable, the notebook has been uploaded **without its output**.

**Running the Notebook Locally:**

To view the full analysis, including the generated visualizations and results, please follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Tanishashahi/Crime_data_analysis.git
    cd Crime_data_analysis
    ```

2.  **Ensure you have the required libraries installed:**
    This notebook relies on the following Python libraries:
    * plotly
    * seaborn
    * matplotlib
    * numpy
    * pandas

    You can install these libraries using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install plotly seaborn matplotlib numpy pandas
    ```
    Alternatively, if you are using Anaconda, you can use conda:
    ```bash
    conda install plotly seaborn matplotlib numpy pandas
    ```

3.  **Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed. You can then run the notebook using the following command in your terminal within the repository directory:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Crime_data_analysis.ipynb
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    jupyter lab Crime_data_analysis.ipynb
    ```

    This will open the notebook in your web browser. You can then execute the cells to see the output.

**Presentation:**

During the presentation, I will run the notebook locally to demonstrate the generated outputs, including interactive plots and analysis results.

**[Optional: Add any other relevant information, such as:]**

* A brief overview of the notebook's sections.
* The dataset(s) used (and where to find them if they are not included in the repository).
* Key findings or conclusions.
* Contact information or how to contribute.

    ```
**Presentation:**

During the presentation, I will run the notebook locally to demonstrate the generated outputs, including interactive plots showing sales by region and product category, as well as key statistical summaries.

**Dataset:**

The analysis uses a `sales_data.csv` file included in this repository.

**Key Findings:**

[Briefly mention 1-2 key insights from your analysis].
